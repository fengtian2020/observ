  Apart from remote sensing imagery, we also use UAVs and *insitu* measurements. We are currently establishing two eddy covariance towers in Nyingchi in southeast Tibet. The site is locating at a treeline of 3700 m a.s.l. to the west of [Namcha Barwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namcha_Barwa).
  
  We do research on vegetation phenology, mountain ecosystems under climate change, drought effects on vegetation growth, and tree diversity in tropical rainforest.
  
  We have close collaboration with University of Copenhagen (Denmark), Lund University (Sweden), and The Copperbelt University (Zambia), with a particular interest in ecosystem dynamics in Africa, including the semi-arid regions in the Sahel, the Miombo woodlands, and the Congo rainforest.
