description: "Welcome to the homepage of ObserV Lab at Wuhan University! We are interested in observing the Earth with remote sensing imagery. Seeing from space, the most dominant thing on land is vegetation —— the primary producer of our planet, which is the main focus of our research. We also study interactions between the terrestrial ecosystem and the climate in various aspects."
